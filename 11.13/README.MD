<div title="Passage 4">
We may have appreciation of the mystery of Stonehenge. Stonehenge is one of the UK’s most visited tourist attractions -and one of the world’s most mysterious ancient monuments. People come from all over the world to stare at the iconic stone pillars and wonder how, and why they were put in place.
The site may be 1________ recognizable, but there is far more to it than first meets the eye. As archaeologists study this area, mystery after mystery unfolds. But a coherent story may be beginning to 2________.
That has been particularly true over the last decade. Researchers have been studying not just the monument itself, but the area around it hoping to find clues in this appealing landscape of prehistoric monuments.
Underground imaging and excavation have revealed that Stonehenge was once part of a complicated 3________ of structures: ancient burial mounds(古坟)，unknown settlements, processional routes and even gold-adorned burials. The 4 ________ paint a picture of a far more mysterious and elaborate Neolithic and Bronze Age world than 5________ thought.
The finding of another huge monument in the area has changed the way archaeologists look at the development and history of the region “Increasingly I would suggest that we are beginning to see the mosaic马赛克)of 6________ areas and monuments as suggesting processional movement” said Gaffney. In other words, the landscape was used in religious or ceremonial processions related to the monuments.
Mike Parker Pearson of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology, who led the Stonehenge Riverside Project from 2003 to 2009, thinks that the posts at Durrington Walls were put up with the 7________ that they would be taken down soon after. “They may only have stood for a matter of months before they were replaced by the henge(圆形结构)bank and ditch,” he said. “Their purpose seems to have been to mark the perimeter(周长，边界)of the great village by now 8________. So perhaps the posts were a monument to the people who lived here while building Stonehenge.”
Whatever the monument was used for, it shows that Stonehenge isn’t alone in this landscape. Understanding the 9________ of Stonehenge depends on understanding everything else around it as well.
Parker Pearson also suggests that the Welsh bluestones were the first to be put in place at Stonehenge, and that it was the monument that they came from that was important. The stones would have been considered to be10________ symbols of western Britons, he said, and “bringing them to Salisbury Plain was an act of unification of the two main Neolithic peoples of southern Britain.”
