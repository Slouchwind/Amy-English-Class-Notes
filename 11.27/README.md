The Norfolk Prison Colony's library was in the school building. A v______ of classes was taught there by instructors who came from such places as Harvard and Boston universities. The weekly debates between prisoner teams were also held in the school building. You would be astonished to know how hard-working prisoner debaters and audiences would get over s______ like "Should Babies Be Fed Milk?"  
A______ on the prison library's shelves were books on just about every general subject. Much of the big private collection that Parkhurst had wiled to the prison was still in boxes in the back of the library—thousands of old books. Parkhurst, I've mentioned, seemed to have been principally interested in history and religion. He had the money and the special i______ to have a lot of books that you wouldn,t have to general circulation. Any college library would have been lucky to get that collection.  
As you can imagine, especially in a prison where there was heavy emphasis on reform a prisoner was smiled upon if he demonstrated an unusually intense interest in books. There was a sizable number of well-read prisoners, especially the popular debaters. Some were said by many to be practically walking encyclopedias. They were almost noted persons. No university would ask any student to read literature so greedily as I did when this new world opened to me, of being a______ to read and understand.  
I read more in my room than in the library itself. A prisoner who was known to read a lot could check out more than the permitted maximum number of books. I p______ reading in the total isolation of my own room.  
When i had progressed to really serious reading, every night at about ten p.m. i would be annoyed with the Tights out”. It always seemed to catch me right in the middle of something absorbing.  
F______ , right outside my door was a conidor light that cast a glow into my room. The glow was enough to read by, once my eyes adjusted to it. So when Tights out" came, I would sit on the floor where I could continue reading in that glow.

If you don't have a college degree, you're at greater risk of developing memory problems or even Alzheimer's （老年痴呆）.Education plays a k______ role in lifelong memory performance and risk for mental disorder, and it's well documented that those with a college degree possess a cognitive （认知的）advantage over their less educated counterparts in middle and old age.  
Now, a large national s______ from Brandeis University published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry shows that those with less schooling can significantly make u______ for poorer education by frequently engaging in mental exercises such as word games, puzzles, reading, and lectures.  
"The lifelong benefits of higher education for memory in later life are quite impressive, but we do not clearly understand how and why these effects last so long," said lead author Margie Lachman, a psychologist. She suggested that higher education may e______ lifelong interest in cognitive efforts, while those with less education may not engage as frequently in mental exercises that help keep the memory agile （敏捷地）.  
But education early in adulthood does not appear to be the only route to maintain your m______ . The study found that intellectual activities undertaken regularly made a difference. "Among individuals with low education, those who are engaged in reading, writing, attending lectures, doing word games or puzzles once a week or more had memory scores similar to people with more education," said Lachman.  
The study, called Midlife in the United States, assessed 3343 men and women between the ages of 32 and 84 with a mean age of 56 years. Almost 40 percent of the p______ had at least a 4-year college degree. The researchers evaluated how the participants performed in two cognitive areas verbal （言语的）memory and executive function --- brain processes involved in planning, abstract thinking and cognitive flexibility. Participants were given a series of tests, i______ tests of verbal fluency, word recall, and backward counting.  
As expected, those with higher education said they engaged in cognitive activities more often and also did b______ on the memory tests, but some with lower education also did well, explained Lachman.
"The findings are promising because they suggest there may be ways to level the playing field for those with lower educational achievement, and p______ those at.greatest risk for memory declines," said Lachman. "Although we cannot rule out the possibility that those who have better memories are the ones who take on more activities, the evidence is consistent with cognitive plasticity （可塑性）,and suggests some degree of personal control over cognitive functioning in adulthood by adopting an intellectually a______ lifestyle."
